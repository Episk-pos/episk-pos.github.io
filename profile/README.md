### *Oversight for Community Resilience*

</div>

## 📖 About

**Episkopos** (ἐπίσκοπος) is derived from the Greek words *epi-* (upon) and *skopos* (to see, watcher). It means "overseer" — one who watches over and ensures things are done correctly, functioning as a superintendent, guardian, or curator.

Our organization embodies this concept by overseeing critical systems and initiatives that strengthen communities and protect our shared future.
